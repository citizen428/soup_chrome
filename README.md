The bookmarklet of the [Soup.io](http://soup.io) microblogging service wrapped up as a Chrome extension.

If you don't use the Bookmarks Bar normally (or recent Chrome builds block the popup), getting to the bookmarklet is not very convenient, so an extension seemed to make more sense. 

The bookmarklet can be either be launched via the action icon or by pressing `Alt-Shift-S`.
